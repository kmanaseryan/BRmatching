#Bottleneck Bichromatic Plane Matching of Points
There is given a set of points on the plane. The points distinguish by their red and blue colors that are equal in amount. The problem is to connect those points by straight line segments such that each segment has red and blue endpoints and there are no any two segments which cross each other. Furthermore, from all longest segments of all matchings the smallest one is chosen.
